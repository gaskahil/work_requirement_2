1. File to List Converter
  Prompt the user for a filename.
  Read all lines from the file into a list.
  Strip whitespace from each line and print the resulting list.
  Handle the case where the file doesn't exist using try/except and print an error message.

2. Task List Manager
  Create a Python module named tasks.py that contains two functions:
  add_task(task_list, task)
  remove_task(task_list, task)
  In your main script, import tasks.py.
  Start with an empty list, repeatedly ask the user for input: "add " or "remove ".
  Use the imported functions to modify the list, and print the updated list after each operation.
  Exit when the user types "done".

3. Simple Class and Inheritance
  Define a Person class that has attributes name and age and a method greet() that prints a greeting.
  Define a Student class that inherits from Person and adds an attribute student_id.
  In your main script, create a Student object and call its greet() method.
  Print the student's student_id as well.

4. Math Quiz with Exception Handling
Use the random module (from the standard library) to generate two random integers and ask the user to add them.
Try to convert the user's input to an integer. If that fails (e.g., user enters non-digit input), handle the exception and print "Invalid input!".
If the input is valid, check if the answer is correct and print a message accordingly.
